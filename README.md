# Using Prophet for Forecasting and Determining Trend and Seasonality of Avocado Average Prices

In today's dynamic and data-driven world, businesses and researchers often face the challenge of accurately forecasting market trends and behaviors.

One powerful tool that has emerged for this purpose is Prophet, a forecasting library developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team (Fayziev et al., 2023).

This research paper aims to explore the application of Prophet in forecasting and analyzing the trend and seasonality of avocado average prices over a given period.

Prophet is a time-series forecasting model that excels in capturing complex patterns in data, including trend and seasonality.

It is particularly well-suited for handling the challenges commonly associated with time-series data, such as missing values, outliers, and holiday effects (Abdullah et al., 2023).

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Prophet in the agricultural domain.

For instance, a review of agricultural product price forecasting methods suggests that the trend is to use hybrid models, which can effectively capture the complex dynamics of agricultural markets (Wang et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the application of prediction models based on price-influencing factors, such as weather and market conditions, is expected to expand in future research (Wang et al., 2020).

i am using prophet model to forecast the average prices of avocado over a given period.

To begin, I will utilize data on the average prices of avocados, which can be obtained from various sources, such as government databases or industry reports.

# Data Preparation for Avocado Price Forecasting

After collecting data, three key procedures are essential for preparing the data for forecasting:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Remove outliers, handle missing values, and normalize data for consistency and accuracy.
2. Feature Engineering: Create relevant features, incorporate external factors, and conduct exploratory data analysis to inform model development.
3. Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate model, split data for training and validation, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model 
   performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, or RMSE.

The benefits of forecasting to determine future prices of avocados are significant and can provide valuable insights for avocado producers. Here are some key benefits based on the provided sources:
1. Improved Decision-Making: Forecasting future avocado prices allows producers to make informed decisions regarding production levels, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.
2. Enhanced Planning: By predicting future prices, avocado farmers can better plan their operations, optimize their supply chain, and anticipate market trends, leading to improved efficiency and profitability.
3. Risk Management: Forecasting helps avocado producers mitigate risks associated with price fluctuations, enabling them to adapt their strategies in response to market changes and uncertainties.
4. Competitive Advantage: Accurate price forecasting provides a competitive edge by allowing producers to adjust their pricing strategies in line with market dynamics, ensuring competitiveness and market relevance.
5. Resource Optimization: Forecasting future prices helps in optimizing resource allocation, inventory management, and marketing efforts, leading to cost savings and improved overall performance.
6. Market Insights: Forecasting provides valuable insights into market trends, consumer behavior, and demand patterns, enabling avocado producers to 
 align their production and marketing strategies with market needs
