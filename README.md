Using Prophet for Forecasting and Determining Trend and Seasonality of Avocado Average Prices

In today's dynamic and data-driven world, businesses and researchers often face the challenge of accurately forecasting market trends and behaviors.

One powerful tool that has emerged for this purpose is Prophet, a forecasting library developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team (Fayziev et al., 2023).

This research paper aims to explore the application of Prophet in forecasting and analyzing the trend and seasonality of avocado average prices over a given period.

Prophet is a time-series forecasting model that excels in capturing complex patterns in data, including trend and seasonality.

It is particularly well-suited for handling the challenges commonly associated with time-series data, such as missing values, outliers, and holiday effects (Abdullah et al., 2023).

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Prophet in the agricultural domain.

For instance, a review of agricultural product price forecasting methods suggests that the trend is to use hybrid models, which can effectively capture the complex dynamics of agricultural markets (Wang et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the application of prediction models based on price-influencing factors, such as weather and market conditions, is expected to expand in future research (Wang et al., 2020).

i am using prophet model to forecast the average prices of avocado over a given period.

To begin, I will utilize data on the average prices of avocados, which can be obtained from various sources, such as government databases or industry reports.
